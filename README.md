# README

Glong is a tool which let's students explore a topic by travelling on a map node by node.
The visit of a node has prerequisited nodes, which must be completed first. The completion
is marked as done after an offline or online assessment. After succesful completion, new nodes
are offered on the map and the learning journey can continue.

The app is built with:

* Ruby 3.1.1

* Rails 7.0.2.4
